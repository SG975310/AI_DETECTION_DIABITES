# Diabetes Early Detection - ML Model Comparison

The code for this project comes from a paper comparing the efficacy of 3 classification algorithms for early diabetes detection: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The paper, "Artificial Intelligence for Early Detection of Disease: A Study on Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, Skin Cancer, and Breast Cancer," is referenced throughout this README.

## Research Question

This project supports the paper's central research question: **can artificial intelligence improve the early detection of disease compared with traditional methods?** For diabetes specifically, the traditional method is a single blood test (HbA1c or fasting glucose) applied after a person seeks testing. This project asks whether a machine learning model, using the same kind of routine health data, can flag risk earlier or more consistently than that single-threshold approach — and, just as importantly, whether one ML algorithm is actually more trustworthy than another once you look past a single accuracy number.

## Project Overview

This project attempts to create 3 machine learning models that can determine if a patient has diabetes based on 8 indicators (variables) in order to predict the likelihood of developing the disease at an early stage. The code for this project implements the methodology used in the published literature (Iparraguirre-Villanueva et al., 2023; Ullah et al., 2022) and builds upon it in an effort to contribute to research regarding the benefits of artificial intelligence in early diagnosis of disease.

## Workflow

## Dataset

Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (originally collected by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)

- Size: 768 patients (all female, of Pima Indian heritage, age 21+)
- Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age
- Target: Outcome (1 = diabetic, 0 = non-diabetic)
- Class balance: 268 diabetic cases (34.9%), 500 non-diabetic cases (65.1%)

![Class distribution](images/chart_class_distribution.png)

The dataset is imbalanced (roughly 2:1 non-diabetic to diabetic), which is part of the reason this project reports precision, recall, and F1 alongside accuracy rather than accuracy alone — a model can score a deceptively high accuracy just by leaning toward the majority class.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before training anything, it's worth looking at how the features relate to each other and to the outcome:

![Correlation heatmap](images/chart_correlation_heatmap.png)

Glucose has the strongest correlation with the diabetes outcome of any single feature, which foreshadows the feature importance result later in this README — the model and the raw correlation numbers agree with each other.

## Preprocessing

Several columns in this dataset use 0 as a placeholder for missing data (a documented quirk of this specific dataset — a value of 0 for Blood Pressure or BMI is not physiologically possible in a living patient). These zero-values were treated as missing and imputed with the column median:

| Column | Missing values (encoded as 0) |
| --- | --- |
| Glucose | 5 |
| Blood Pressure | 35 |
| Skin Thickness | 227 |
| Insulin | 374 |
| BMI | 11 |

## Models Compared

1. Logistic Regression
2. Random Forest
3. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)

All models were trained on an 80-20 train-test split (with stratification applied to the split to reduce potential bias). The data for the Logistic Regression was standardized. Each model was picked for a specific reason rather than just "trying a few things": Logistic Regression as a simple, interpretable baseline; Random Forest as a stronger ensemble method that's still fairly resistant to overfitting; and XGBoost because it's the algorithm most consistently reported as top-performing on structured medical data in the literature this project is built on.

The performance of all 3 algorithms was compared using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC as evaluation metrics — not accuracy alone, since a single metric can hide how a model is actually failing (see Results below).

## Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC-AUC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression | 70.78% | 60.00% | 50.00% | 54.55% | 0.8130 |
| Random Forest | 74.03% | 65.22% | 55.56% | 60.00% | 0.8161 |
| XGBoost | 77.27% | 70.21% | 61.11% | 65.35% | 0.8154 |

![Model comparison](images/chart_model_comparison.png)

![ROC curves](images/chart_roc_curves.png)

XGBoost had the highest performance across every metric on this particular train/test split, which is typical of the algorithm on structured data, according to the literature reviewed. Recall is worth flagging specifically: even XGBoost only caught about 61% of actual diabetic cases in the test set, meaning close to 4 in 10 diabetic patients in this test set would have been missed. That's the kind of detail that gets hidden if you only report accuracy.

### Confusion Matrices

![Confusion matrices](images/chart_confusion_matrices.png)

The confusion matrices show where each model's errors actually land. All three models produce more false negatives (missed diabetic cases) than false positives, which is the less safe direction to err in for a screening tool — a missed case delays treatment, while a false alarm just means an extra follow-up test.

### Cross-Validation: A More Honest Picture

A single 80/20 split can make a model look better or worse than it really is, just based on which patients happened to land in the test set. To check this, all 3 models were also run through 5-fold stratified cross-validation:

![Cross-validation results](images/chart_cross_validation.png)

This produced a genuinely interesting result: **on the single train/test split, XGBoost had the highest accuracy (77.27%). But under 5-fold cross-validation, Logistic Regression actually came out on top (77.34% average, with the lowest variance across folds), while XGBoost's average cross-validated accuracy (74.21%) was noticeably lower than its single-split result.**

This suggests XGBoost's single-split performance may have been partly a good draw of which patients ended up in that particular test set, rather than a consistently superior model. It's a useful reminder — for this project and in general — that a single train/test split isn't enough to declare a "winner," and that cross-validation is what actually tells you how stable a model's performance is.

## Feature Importance (according to the Random Forest model)

![Feature importance](images/chart_feature_importance.png)

The most important variable was glucose, followed by BMI and Diabetes Pedigree Function (which is related to genetics). This validates the claims made in Section 4.3 ("Common Algorithms Used in Detection Models") of the paper, as evidenced by the emphasis placed on blood sugar levels and hemoglobin A1c as diagnostic criteria for diabetes. It also matches the correlation heatmap above — the feature most correlated with the outcome is also the feature the model leaned on most.

## Comparison to Published Literature

As mentioned earlier, this project's 77.27% accuracy is significantly lower than the 99.41% accuracy achieved by Iparraguirre-Villanueva et al. (2023).

Reasons for this discrepancy could include:

1. **Different Datasets:** It's entirely possible that the research of Iparraguirre-Villanueva et al. was conducted on a larger dataset than the famous Pima Indians dataset used for this project.
2. **Class Imbalance:** Another reason could be the imbalance between the number of samples of each class (768 patients, of which only 268 were diabetic). This is especially likely given that the test set only had 154 patients (25.8% of the dataset). There is obviously a possibility of inaccuracy due to a small sample size.
3. **No Hyperparameter Tuning:** The 3 models weren't tuned for optimal performance. The default parameters (with some minor tweaking) were sufficient for the purpose of this project, which is primarily academic.

However, this is an academic exercise meant to contribute to the body of knowledge on AI/ML applications in early diagnosis, and this particular result actually serves to further one of the theses of this paper: namely, that there is a significant amount of bias in data science. This result can be used to support the claims made in Section 6.1 ("Bias in Training Data") of the paper, as it shows how different results can come from similar methods due to differences in data and hyperparameters.

## How to Reproduce

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/train_models.py            # trains all 3 models, runs 5-fold CV, saves results/results.json
python src/make_charts.py             # generates all comparison and EDA charts into images/
python src/make_workflow_diagram.py   # generates the workflow diagram into images/
```

All random operations (train/test split, model initialization, cross-validation folds) use a fixed random seed (42), so re-running the pipeline reproduces the exact numbers reported in this README.

## Limitations

1. Small dataset, which can lead to less accurate results, and the cross-validation results above suggest this project's single train/test split may not be fully representative of true model performance.
2. Non-representative sample (only Pima Indian women of age 21+) - this limitation ties into the potential sources of bias mentioned in Section 6.1.
3. Lack of hyperparameter tuning - all 3 models were run close to default settings, so these results represent a baseline rather than each model's best possible performance.
4. This should be taken as an academic exercise and not implemented anywhere close to a real-world setting.

## Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning (e.g. grid search or Bayesian optimization) for all 3 models, to see whether the gap to the published 99.41% closes at all once each model is actually optimized rather than run near-default.
- Testing on a larger, more diverse dataset to check whether the cross-validation vs. single-split discrepancy (see Results) holds up, shrinks, or reverses with more data.
- SHAP value analysis for a more granular, per-prediction explanation of feature contributions, beyond the global feature importance shown here.
- Applying the same pipeline to a second diabetes dataset to directly test how much of the published 99.41% vs. this project's 77.27% gap is dataset-driven rather than method-driven.
